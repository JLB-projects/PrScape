# Project: Scape
Project: Scape. A minimalistic take on the classic version of popular game Runescape.

Primarily intended as a learning experience, I tried to avoid using any major packages and especially game related ones that would trivialise the work needed. Since I don't plan on working with games much in the future, anything I learn about those specific packages would be wasted. Instead I decided to build my own basic systems from the ground up, even if they aren't the best possible implementations, just to get a better feel for what is possible and efficient with basic python. 

The largest package that is heavily used is Tkinter. While originally envisioned as a text/console based project, I quickly decided it would be more realistic to have at least a basic GUI in 2021. In addition, many core modules like time, random and threading were used out of necessity.

Again, due to the nature of the project, the quality of code throughout will vary depending on the time at which it was written. While I could go back and change a lot of the early design choices, it would take too much time for little gain compared to moving on to something new.
