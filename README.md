# Project: Scape
Project: Scape. A minimalistic take on the classic version of popular game Runescape.

Primarily intended as a learning experience, I tried to avoid using any major packages and especially game related ones that would trivialise the work needed. Since I don't plan on working with games much in the future, anything I learn about those specific packages would be wasted. Instead I decided to build my own basic systems from the ground up, even if they aren't the best possible implementations, just to get a better feel for what is possible and efficient with basic python. 

The largest package that is heavily used is Tkinter. While originally envisioned as a text/console based project, I quickly decided it would be more realistic to have at least a basic GUI in 2021. In addition, many core modules like time, random and threading were used out of necessity.

Again, due to the nature of the project, the quality of code throughout will vary depending on the time at which it was written. While I could go back and change a lot of the early design choices, it would take too much time for little gain compared to moving on to something new. In a similar vein the formatting of the code may not be perfectly in line with common standards since I just relied on Pycharm warnings and recommendations throughout most of the process, before discovering that this does not match the guidelines in their entirety.

The nature of the project allows me to easily add more in future if I want to test out something new or while learning more advanced methods. For example, I only added the account system late in development to play around with SQLite, and it wasn't too difficult to get things working again. As a result you can now use multiple password protected accounts even though they are being stored locally, due to (hopefully) proper treatment of the passwords.

As a final note before moving on to the actual gameplay: the world building was based heavily on the original Runescape to save time, but with some changes where I felt they were needed or interesting. The game's core mechanics (like how skills are trained) were intended to follow the source material where possible, but obviously being made from scratch due to the very different style of gameplay, and with some creative liberties at times. The main benefit of this approach was the existence of clear goals, since I am very goal-oriented and this gave me a large list of mini projects to work through from the beginning.
